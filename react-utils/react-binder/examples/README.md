# React-Binder Examples App
## Overview
Under this folder there is a simple set of examples of using the nelson-react-binder utility to create a binded state that updates setState when there is a change.


## Running the sample App
Usually this would require to clone the repository and then perform the link an install.
If you just want to run you can jump to the "**[All commands together](#All-commands-together)**" bellow.


### Setup
1. Clone the repository locally:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nelson-perez/nelson.git
    ```
2. Traverse to the __./nelson/react-utils/react-binder/examples__ directory


### Running the Examples App
Under the ***examples*** folder just run `npm start`. This will automatically download all the dependencies for the `nelson-react-binder` and `examples` and run the app. It should open the browser to [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000)
```bash
npm start
```
Once the App is loaded and running a browser window should appear going to the application address.

If it doesn't you can go directly to the App in http://localhost:3000/


### All commands togethers
To make it easier I include a section with all the commands together like a script that you can just run.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nelson-perez/nelson.git
cd nelson/react-utils/react-binder/examples
npm start
```
