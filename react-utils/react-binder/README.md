#Reaact Binder


## Overview
Simple utility to create a binded state that updates the state when there is a change.



## Installation
Install to your NodeJS project using [npm](https://npmjs.org).
```bash
npm install react-binder
```

## API
### `ComponentBinder.create<P extends {}, S extends {}>()`
This method provides the necesary functionality that allows to create a BindedState object that can be used instead of the regular `Component.state` which automatically updates teh state of your component when you perform changes to the binded state 

#### Parameters of `ComponentBinder.create<P extends {}, S extends {}>()`
|Name               | Description|
|         -         |   -   |
|***TProps***       | Type of the Component properties|
|***TState***       | Type of the Component state|
|__inputFile__      | File path of the file that contains data delimited by a _newline_ `"\n"` to be sorted.|
|__outputFile__     | File path of the output sorted data delimited by a _newline_ `"\n"`.|
|__inputMapFn__     | Function that maps/parses a `string` from a single line of the input file into a **TValue** type.|
|__outputMapFn__    | Function maps/serializes each **TValue** into a single line `string` for the output file.|
|__compareFn__      | Comparer function of **TValue** types to define the sorting order. _example_: `(a, b) => a > b? 1 : -1`|
|__linesPerFile__   | Max number of lines processed for each file split. _`It's recommended to keep the default value for performance.`_|


#### Function definition of `sortFile()`
```typescript
/**
 * The `sortFile()` method sorts the content of an input file and writes the results into an output file.
 * It's designed to handled large files that would not fit into memory by using an external merge sort algorithm.
 * (see: {@link https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_sorting})
 * 
 * This method parses each line of the input file into {@link TValue} instances, sorts them and finally
 * serializes and writes these {@link TValue} instances into lines of the output file via the parameters
 * {@link inputMapFn}, {@link compareFn} and {@link outputMapFn} funtions respectively.
 * 
 * 
 * The sort order is determined by the {@link compareFn} which specifies the precedence of the {@link TValue} instances.
 * @examples
 * - increasing order sort compareFn: (a, b) => a > b? 1 : -1
 * - decreasing order sort compareFn: (a, b) => a < b? 1 : -1
 * 
 * Note:
 * It is recommended to not specify the {@link linesPerFile} parameter to keep the default value of 100,000.
 * The `sortFile()` function has been tested/benchmarked for the best sorting/io performance and 100,000 gave the
 * best results during bechmarking tests.
 * 
 * The {@link linesPerFile} can be specified only for special scenarios when you need to overcome the `too many files`
 * error when restricted of other options or to tune performance for larger `TValue` instances or slow temp file IO.
 * 
 * When sorting tremendously large files the following error may occur:
 *  ---------------------------------------
 * | `Error: EMFILE, too many open files`  |
 *  ---------------------------------------
 * This error occurs when the input has been splited into more streams/files than the user can concurrently open
 * during the k-file merge process which opens all those splitted files at the same time.
 * 
 * To overcome this error you'll need to increase the maximum number of concurrent open stream/files limit by
 * either using the `$ ulimit -n <max concurrent open files/streams (default: 1024)>` command or updating the
 * `/etc/security/limit.conf` file.
 * 
 * If the steps above are not feasible then you could overcome it by specifying a larger value to the 
 * {@link linesPerFile} parameter above the default 100,000 which could result less files to merge.
 * 
 * 
 * @template TValue                     - Specifies type of a parsed instance to sort from the input file.
 * 
 * @param {string}      inputFile       - Location of the input file to sort with data delimited by a newline.
 * @param {string}      outputFile      - Location of output file to write the sorted data delimited by a newline.
 * @param {Function}    inputMapFn      - Function that parses/deserializes an input file line `string` into a
 *                                        {@link TValue} instance.
 * @param {Function}    outputMapFn     - Function that serializes each {@link TValue} instance into a single line
 *                                        `string` of the ouput file.
 * @param {Function}    compareFn       - Function that compares {@link TValue} instances to determine their sort order.
 *                                        See: {@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort#parameters}
 * @param {number}      linesPerFile    - Maximum number of lines per temporary split file. Keep default value of 100K.
 * 
 * @return {Promise<void>}              - Promise that once resolved the output sorted file has been completely 
 *                                        created and temporary files has been cleaned up.

## Usage examples
Here are examples showing the scenarios where this would be useful.

#### Sorting numbers
Here is an example that explain each of the parameters and how to use it to sort a file with `Numbers` and outputs the numbers as strings.

```typescript

 // Function that tansforms a line from input file into a number to use for comparison.
 let inputMapFunction = input: string => Number(input);


 // Function that tansform a parsed number back into string as a line for the output file.
 let outputMapFuncton = output: number => output.toString();


 // Function that compares two numbers to define their sort order.
 let compareFunction = (a: number, b: number) => a > b? 1 : -1;


 // Sorts the lines of the file "input_file.txt" as numbers and outputs it to the "out_sorted_file.txt" file
 await sortFile<number>(
    'input_file.txt',
    'output_sorted_file.txt',
    inputMapFunction,
    outputMapFuncton,
    compareFunction);

 ```


 #### Sort CSV file by the second column
 This example shows how to sort a csv file based on the value of the second column by parsing the csv into an array, sorting the array based on the second column and writting the array back into the csv format.

 ```typescript

 // Function that transforms the input csv row into an array with the values.
function parseCsv(inputLine: string): string[] {
    let array = inputLine.split(',');
    return array;
}

// Function to transforms the csv value array into a csv row `string` line for output.
function outputCsv(array: string[]): string {
    let outputLine = array.join(',');
    return outputLine;
}

// Sorts the file base on the second column of the csv file
await sortFile<string[]>(
    'input.csv',                    // inputFile    - input csv file
    'sorted_output.csv',            // outputFile   - sorted output csv file
    parseCsv,                       // inputMapFn   - maps the input csv row into an array of column values
    outputCsv,                      // outputMapFn  - maps the array of values into a csv row to output
    (a, b) => a[1] > b[1]? 1 : -1); // compareFn    - compares the second column to sort in ascending order

 ```

#### Sort CSV input and outputs lines of JSON
 This example shows how to sort a csv file based on the value of the second column and output parsed JSON. Does this parsing the csv into an object with fiels `col1` and `col2`, sorts these objects by the `col2` field and writes the object to a output lines as JSON.

 ```typescript

 // Function that transforms the input csv row into an object.
function parseCsv(inputLine: string): {col1: string, col2: string} {
    let array = inputLine.split(',');
    return {
        col1: array[0],
        col2: array[1]
    };
}

// Function that transform the parsed object into a JSON string
function outputJSON(obj: {col1: string, col2: string}): string {
    let ouputLine = JSON.stringify(obj);
    return outputLine;
}

// Sorts the file base on the second column of the csv file
await sortFile<{col1: string, col2: string}>(
    'input.csv',                        // inputFile    - input csv file
    'sorted_output.txt',                // outputFile   - sorted output csv file
    parseCsv,                           // inputMapFn   - maps the input line `string` to an object
    outputJSON,                         // outputMapFn  - maps the object into a json string [JSON.stringify]
    (a, b) => a.col2 < b.col2? 1 : -1); // compareFn    - compare the field col2 to sort in descending order

 ```

 #### Sort CSV by the combination of two columns
 This example shows how to sort a csv file based on the value columns 1 and column2 by parsing the csv into an object containing a field `sortBy` and the array of values, sorts the objects by the `sortBy` field and writes the array of values into the csv format.

 *Note:*
 The computation of the data to sort by is done ahead of time once during the input parsing in the `parseCsv()` call instead of on each comparison `compareFn` call for performance reasons.

 ```typescript

 // Function that transforms the input csv row into an object with a `sortBy` field 
function parseCsv(inputLine: string): {sortBy: string, array: string[]} {
    let array = inputLine.split(',');
    // Generating the sort by value ahead of time once instead of on comparison `compareFn` call.
    return {
        sortBy: array[0] + array[1] 
        array: array
    };
}

// Function that transform the object into a json string
function outputCSV(obj: {sortBy: string, array: string[]}): string {
    let ouputLine = obj.array.join(',');
    return outputLine;
}

// Sorts the file based on the combination of columns 1 and 2 from the csv file
await sortFile<{sortBy: string, array: string[]}>(
    'input.csv',                            // inputFile    - input csv file
    'sorted_output.txt',                    // outputFile   - sorted output csv file
    parseCsv,                               // inputMapFn   - maps the input line `string` to an object
    outputJSON,                             // outputMapFn  - maps the object into a csv row line to ouput
    (a, b) => a.sortBy > b.sortBy? 1 : -1); // compareFn    - compares using `sortBy` field to sort in ascending order

 ```
